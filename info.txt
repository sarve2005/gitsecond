actually this is a fun and clumpsy code i did, if any mistakes don't concentrate on it :)
to change branch use "git checkout <branch name>"
to see branch list use "git branch -a"
to see difference between branches use "git diff <branchname>"
for merging branches use "git merge <branchname>" then push it
